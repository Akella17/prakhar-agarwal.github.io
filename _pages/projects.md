### Autonomous Quadcopter control (Aug 2014- Dec 2014) <br>
** Modelled and tested automated Quadcopter control across one degree of freedom
Used neural networks to perform reinforcement learning in a continuous action space using FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network) library.

### Sentiment Analysis on Twitter feed using Active Learning <br>
** Used active learning with a linear Support Vector Machine for learning sentiment classification models to be applied to
microblogging data streams.

### Reatime demographic insights on App features<br>
** A platform which enables android users to visualize their daily phone usage statistics and intern earn money. The anonymised statistics are provided as a service to companies/startups enabling them to understand the demographic usage of various popular android application features using the android acceessibity service.
Worked with Elastic search, kibana, Android accessibity service.
*Presented at Sequoia::Hack Finals, 2016*
