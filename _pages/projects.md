### Speaker Recognition using Neural Networks

*Machine Vision Laboratory, IIT Roorkee* \| January 2018 – May 2018<br>
<i>Supervisors: Dr. Ajit K Chaturvedi, Professor & Director, IIT Roorkee and Dr. R Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
* Trained a speaker recognition neural network using softmax classifier.<br>
* Trained a speaker embedding neural network using triplet loss funtion.<br>

### Motion Vector Encryption on MPEG Video Files

*Signal Processing Laboratory, IIT Roorkee* \| January 2017 – April 2017<br>
<i>Supervisor: Dr. Vinod Pankajakshan, Assistant Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
* Extract and encrypt the motion vectors of an MPEG video file.<br>
* Our modified approach consists of shifting the present motion vectors based on the previously encrypted frame,providing greater immunity from random guessing attacks.<br>

### Enhanced MAC (Multiply and Accumulate) unit used in modern DSP Processors

*Embedded Systems Course Project* \| October 2016<br>
<i>Supervisor: Dr. Brajesh Kumar Kaushik, Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
* Designed an enhanced MAC unit with pipelined architecture to increase the throughput.<br>
