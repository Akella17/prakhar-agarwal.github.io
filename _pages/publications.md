* <b>Super Resolution as a Supervised Learning Problem</b> <br>
<i><b>Akella Ravi Tej</b>, Dr. Vinod Pankajakshan.</i> <br>
  * Working on a manuscript<br>
  * Surveys recent work in the area of single image super resolution (SISR), covering advances in neural network
architectures, learning algorithms, objective functions, and how they all overcome the ill-posed nature of SISR.<br>
  * Special emphasis on perceptual loss functions as a better alternative to point estimate objective functions, which
suffer from regression-to-the-mean problem.

* <b>A Randomized Kernel-Based Secret Image Sharing Scheme</b> <br>
<i><b>Akella Ravi Tej</b>, Rekula Ravi Teja, Dr. Vinod Pankajakshan.</i> <br>
  * The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00181"><u>paper</u></a> proposes a kernel-based operation that enhances the share secrecy of Thien-Linâ€™s scheme while not compromising on decentralization (no SPOF) and optimal share sizes.<br>
  * Presented at the IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2018.8630770"><u>10.1109/WIFS.2018.8630770</u></a>).
