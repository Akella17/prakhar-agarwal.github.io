### Analog Design Internship <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/TI.png" alt="Drawing" width="150" height="50" align="right"/>

*Texas Instruments, Bengaluru, India* \| May 2017 – July 2017 <br>
<i>Supervisor: Ankur Kumar Singh, Analog Design Engineer, Texas Instruments</i> <br>
Worked on automatic generation of Design Verification environment. A python script that would take an xlsx file as input to generate the required test conditions.<br>
Removes human role (bottleneck) in the verification pipeline, saving significant employee time and effort.

Bachelor Thesis <br />
*Signal Processing Laboratory, IIT Roorkee* \| December 2017 – May 2018<br>
<i>Supervisor: Dr. Vinod Pankajakshan, Assistant Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
Trained existing SR networks with perceptual loss function to generate more realistic images.
Trained an image compression model that stores images in a low-dimensional representation and reconstructs
them using different decoders for nonpaying and premium users.
Uses convolutional autoencoders to provide greater compression ratios and SR network trained on perceptual loss
for image upscaling.
