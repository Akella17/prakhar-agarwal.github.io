*California Institute of Technology, Pasadena* \| Aug 2018 – Present<br>
<i>Supervisors: Prof. Anima Anandkumar, Bren Professor, California Institute of Technology<br>
Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Ph.D. Candidate, University of California, Irvine</i><br>
* Unifying count-based exploration and intrinsic motivation over state-action space, an extension of count-based
exploration in state space. Based on the work in Bellemare et al. 2016 and Ostrovski et al. 2017 at DeepMind.
* Uses PixelCNN++ network and U-net architecture to design the density model.
* Decoupling the optimistic Q(s, a) function into two separate Q networks to improve the Q-learning.

### Research Intern <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/IITR.jpg" alt="Drawing" width="90" height="90" align="right"/>

*Signal Processing Laboratory, IIT Roorkee* \| December 2017 – May 2018<br>
<i>Supervisor: Dr. Vinod Pankajakshan, Assistant Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
* Trained existing SR networks with perceptual loss function to generate more realistic images.<br>
* Trained an image compression model that stores images in a low-dimensional representation and reconstructs
them using different decoders for nonpaying and premium users.<br>
* Uses convolutional autoencoders to provide greater compression ratios and SR network trained on perceptual loss
for image upscaling.

### Remote Intern <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/IMSC.png" alt="Drawing" width="90" height="90" align="right"/>

<i>Supervisor: Dr. R Ramanujam, Professor, Theoretical Computer Science, IMSc</i> | November 2017 – April 2018<br>
* Literature survey on zero-knowledge proofs, elliptic curve cryptography and bilinear pairings.<br>
* Use of pi-calculus to verify cryptographic protocols.. <br />

### Research Intern <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/IITR.jpg" alt="Drawing" width="90" height="90" align="right"/>

*Machine Vision Lab, IIT Roorkee* \| January 2017 – Oct 2017<br>
<i>Supervisor: Dr. R Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee</i><br>
* Simulate deduplication in a Cloud-Based System using Convergent Key Management.<br>
* Block level deduplication achieved using SHA-256 (Convergent Key).<br>
* Master Key on local device to prevent “Confirmation of a File Attack”. <br />

### Analog Design Internship <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/TI.png" alt="Drawing" width="150" height="50" align="right"/>

*Texas Instruments, Bengaluru, India* \| May 2017 – July 2017 <br>
<i>Supervisor: Ankur Kumar Singh, Analog Design Engineer, Texas Instruments</i> <br>
* Worked on automatic generation of Design Verification environment. A python script that would take an xlsx file as input to generate the required test conditions.<br>
* Removes human role (bottleneck) in the verification pipeline, saving significant employee time and effort.

### Undergraduate Proficiency <img src="https://akella17.github.io/images/aries.jpg" alt="Drawing" width="65" height="65" align="right"/>

*Artificial Intelligence and Electronics Society (ArIES), IIT Roorkee* \| January 2016 – March 2016 <br>
* Induced touch detection using optics(Infrared radiation, total internal reflection and blog detection). <br>
* Simulated Touch Screen device
