<b>About Me</b>
<hr>
I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with minors in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, India.<br><br>
My journey in ML started with CSN-471(Computer Vision), a course I audited in the pre-final year of my Undergrad. The achievements accomplished by cascading 
<b> simple non-linear feature extractors </b>
were both shocking and intriguing. All those tasks that I felt were implausible to solve (by human engineering) were being solved one after another at a near-human level accuracy. I wanted to be a part of this game.<br>
<br>
My work is based on understanding deep learning architectures. I derive a lot of my motivation from the universality of neural networks and questioning their true expressive powers<br>
<br>
Having worked on diverse yet simple problems across various domains, I possess a solid understanding of deep learning its priors and its contemporaries.<br>
